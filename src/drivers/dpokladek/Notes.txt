-- Behavior Tree's plan --

root (base) :
	|-> (decorator) some sort of reset node?
		|-> (sequence) Accel/Brake : Turning : Gears
			|-> (selector) Accel/Brake
				|-> (leaf) Accelerate Node	- accelerate if below max speed of next segment
				|-> (leaf) Brake Node		- brake if above max speed of the next segment
			
			|-> (selector) Turning
				|-> (leaf) Turn Towards Racing Line Node	- calculate the angle towards racing line
				|-> (leaf) Keep The Same Angle Node			- at the racing line, continue the same way
			
			|-> (selector) Gears
				|-> (leaf) Gear UP		- at rev limiter, gear up
				|-> (leaf) Gaer Down	- revs too low, gear down


IN MY HEAD:
	The sequence will run the beahvior tree, in order it will check for the acceleration/braking, turning and the gears.
	First it will check if we need to accelerate or brake (according to next segment), and adjust the variables accordingly.
	Second it will check the turning, and if we need to move towards the racing line or we can continue the way we are going.
	Third it will check the gears, if we are reving high/low change the gears accordingly. This should drive the car around?

NODES:

AccelerateNode	:	calculate if we need to accelerate, return success and set brakeVal & accelVal to calculation
					else return failure

BrakeNode		:	calculate if we need to brake, set success and set brakeVal & accelVal to calculation
					else return failure

TowardsLineNode	:	calculate if we need to turn towards racing line, if we do set it on blackboard, return success
					else return failure

KeepDrivingNode	:	keep the same 'turnAngle' as we are within the racing line limits

GearUPNode		:	calculate if we need to gear up, return success
					else return failure

GearDownNode	:	calculate if we need to gear down, return success
					else return failure
